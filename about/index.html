    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Eighteen years ago, the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois (ACM@UIUC) held its first computing conference. 150 students from across the midwest attended the event, which was supported by 14 corporations. Since its beginning, the conference has grown to include the MechMania programming contest, Puzzlebang challenge, and two career fairs. This year, we're proud to welcome you to the 19th annual conference from October 10-13, 2013, at the Urbana-Champaign campus. We expect to have over 900 student attendees and over 30 corporate sponsors. ACM could not host Reflections | Projections without the generous support of our sponsors. Their donations fund all the events and help keep admission free for everyone.</p>
