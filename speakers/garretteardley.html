bio: Garrett "Grizzly" Eardley is a software engineer at Riot Games. He is intimately acquainted with the difficulties of scaling the distributed systems that power League of Legends to reach 67 million players each month. Garrett holds an M.S. in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, where he currently resides with his wife, children, and beard.
abstract: Riot Games’s League of Legends supports millions of concurrent players at any given moment of the day. At that scale, tracking simple gameplay statistics results in the creation of terabytes of data that must be aggregated and presented to players. Scaling the system and developing additional features became difficult with Riot's initial stats system. To enable rapid iteration at scale, Riot built a new stats system to support features like the new Match History website. In this talk, I'll discuss in detail the backend architecture of the new stats system, the reasoning behind our technical choices for the system, and the challenges we faced building the system and scaling it to support the new Match History website.
