abstract: Most people today will tell you about how we build software, but at times we get so caught up in the question of how, we forget to ask why.  In his talk James Portnow will look at why we build games and why we care about them.  He will ask what more we can do with them and what it is about them that makes them effect us so much.  And, in the end, he will ask you to do more than simply build, he will ask you to create.
