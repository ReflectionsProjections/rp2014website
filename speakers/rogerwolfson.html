tagline: Engineering Lead - Online Services @ Bungie
bio: Roger has been an engineer at Bungie since graduating from UIUC in 2001. He has led the online services team since 2004's launch of a stats-tracking website for Halo 2, as it has grown to a full online-game engineering team of 25 people. They now create the software that lets Destiny support millions of players hitting servers that are responsible for mission and character state, mobile companion apps, and more. When time allows, he tries to incorporate features based on improbable past coursework such as ASTR 396 - Radio-interferometry.
