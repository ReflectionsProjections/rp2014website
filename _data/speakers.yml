  bio: "Steve LaValle started working with Oculus VR a few days after its successful Kickstarter campaign and led its R&D efforts up to its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook in March 2014.  He developed perceptually tuned head tracking methods used in the Oculus Rift, based on IMUs and computer vision.  He also led a team of perceptual psychologists to provide principled approaches to virtual reality system calibration and the design of comfortable user experiences.  He is also Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois.  He has worked in robotics for over 20 years and is known for his introduction of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRTs) algorithm of motion planning and his book, Planning Algorithms."
  talk_title: "Virtual Reality - Full Steam Ahead"
  abstract: "Using the latest technology, we can safely hijack your most trusted senses, thereby fooling your brain into believing you are in another world.  Virtual reality (VR) has been around for a long time, but due to the recent convergence of sensing, display, and computation technologies, there is an unprecedented opportunity to explore this form of human augmentation with lightweight, low-cost materials and simple software platforms. This is an intense form of human-computer interaction (HCI) that requires re-examining core engineering principles with a direct infusion of perceptual psychology research. Developing systems that optimize classical criteria might lead to overcomplicated solutions that are too slow or costly in practice, and yet could make no perceptible difference to users. Simple adaptation of techniques that were developed for on-screen viewing, such as cinematography and first-person shooter game play, often lead to unpleasent VR experiences due the presentation of unusual stimuli or due to mismatches between the human vestibular system and other senses. With the rapid rise in consumer VR, fundamental research questions are popping up everywhere, slicing across numerous disciplines from engineering to socialogy to film to medicine.  This talk will provide some perspective on where we have been and where we might be going next."

  talk_title: "Challenges in Software Modification"
  abstract: "In the modern world—a world where software has become one of our most important tools—a lot of attention is given to the idea of “open source”; a revolution that has made the behavior of software transparent and empowered users to maintain and enhance the code they rely on in their everyday lives. In this talk, I will first examine some of the edge cases and even limitations of open software, especially as we see closed hardware begin to dominate the ecosystem. I will then focus on the elusory boundary between “open” and “closed”, showing the techniques used to “modify the unmodifiable”, both in analysis and instrumentation, going into particular detail on the phenomenon of “jailbroken” devices running iOS and Android. Finally, I will discuss some of the challenges this culture of “malleable software” faces and how you can help, touching on issues of legality, practicality, and morality, exploring individual motivation, societal expectation, and governmental regulation. (Please note that my talks are fast-paced and wide-reaching, so I recommend splashing some cold water on your face before attending ;P.)"

  abstract: "Early-stage companies revolve around the search for \'product-market fit\'  finding something people want. But once a need is found, the transition into hyper-growth happens alarmingly quickly, with little time to look back or course-correct. This talk will focus on technical operations deployment, availability, monitoring, and other ops-related topics in the face of 5% growth per week, all the way to billions of requests per day. We will focus particularly on (1) hardware platforms, including detailed performance benchmarks and analysis of financial cost, (2) deployment pipelines, (3) how to monitor ALL THE THINGS and (3) what matters early on, and what doesn't.

An entrepreneur since age 9, Kevin dropped out of Princeton University to devote his time to FlightCar, which he sees as revolutionizing the way people get to and from the airport. The idea came about one day when he and  best friend and co­founder Rujul Zaparde (CEO) were talking about Airbnb. Kevin had just come back  from a trip, and was thinking about how expensive parking and car rentals were and how they added to airport congestion and waste. Together, they believed FlightCar, a new car­sharing business focused on the airport customer, could overall improve a traveler’s experience, and encourage travel. Before FlightCar, Kevin ran a successful business that generated over half a million dollars in annual revenue and co­founded an award­ winning clean water NGO, called Drinking Water for India with FlightCar CEO  Rujul.

Concepts that may seem great on the surface may never translate into an investable company, while a new technology which may have no immediately apparent applications may one day change the world. What should you look for when evaluating an opportunity - from your perspective, but also from the eyes of potential investors down the line? And finally, many people work hard to turn their dreams into a reality, only to see everything fall apart - and not because of a poor idea, but rather, because of something that could have been avoided.
