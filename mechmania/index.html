      <h2>MechMania is a 24-hour programming contest in which teams of students from various schools compete to create an AI capable of playing (and winning) a strategy game that we have developed for the event.</h2>

      <h3>Who's eligible?</h3>
      <p>We accept teams of up to three people in two brackets: the student competition and the corporate competition.</p>
      <h4>Student Competitoin</h4>
      <p>Our student competition accepts up to 64 teams and puts them against each other in one final battle. Teams do not need to be comprised of all students from the same school, but all participants must be actively enrolled in a college or university.</p>
      <h4>Corporate Competition</h4>
      <p>The corporate competition is open to teams representing companies. Be sure to contact us if your company is interested in participating in this year's competition. There are no prizes (other than the joy of winning) for corporate competitors.</p>

      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <p>At least one, and preferably all, members of each team will need general familiarity with a Linux shell (bash, zsh, and csh are all provided on our workstations). All members should be proficient in the programming language their team intends to use. The API will use JSON messages passed over HTTP, so we recommend having knowledge of a JSON library in your chosen language.</p>

  <div class="row mt">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <h3>What you don't need to know</h3>
      <p>No prior knowledge of any specific languages are required. You won't need a background in artificial intelligence—in previous years, many teams without an AI background have competed and done well, or even won. You also shouldn't need knowledge of network programming beyond HTTP requests.</p>

      <h3>What you should bring</h3>
      <p>This year, competitors can develop on their own computers. We’ll have specific build instructions once you get to the event to make sure everything you make will run well on lab machines, but if you didn’t get a lab machine when you signed up, you’ll need your own computer to develop on. You can also bring any reference manual(s) you wish, whether it be the Art of Computer Programming or the Art of War. You may bring non-code items like rc files, build scripts, notes, etc, but absolutely no outside code</p>

      <h3>What we'll give you</h3>
      <p>Teams will be provided documentation about the Mechmania API and a lab machine if you signed up for one. Your code should be platform-independent to ensure compatibility with the competition environment. You will have access to the internet throughout the competition and are free to find reference materials, documentation and third party libraries.</p>

      <h3>What you'll do</h3>
      <p>By either starting from scratch or using our provided sample clients, you will build an artificial intelligence client to play a strategy game of our design. Our API will provide you information about the current state of the game, as well as allow you to send commands to play it. You may find previous competition sites useful to get an idea of how MechMania operates.</p>

      <h3>When it'll happen</h3>
      <p>This year we have changed the start time for the competition based on feedback from previous years' participants. The competition will begin with the opening ceremony and announcement of the game on Friday, October 11, after which the programming component will commence immediately. The competition will end Saturday evening after running for 24 hours. We will present the closing ceremony and awards Sunday afternoon.</p>

      <h3>Footnotes
</h3>
      <p>1 You may only use languages and language features that compile and run on our test machine. Note that this means you should avoid Linux-specific C/C++. Pure Unix-targeted code should suffice.</p>
